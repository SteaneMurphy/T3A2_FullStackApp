## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}PROJECT DESCRIPTION}}$

### ${\textsf{\color{lightblue}PURPOSE}}$

TravelMate Itinerary Builder is designed to assist TravelMate, a boutique travel agency, in overcoming challenges related to efficiently managing personalised travel itineraries for their clients. According to a study by American Express Travel (2024), 85% of travellers plan to book a personalised travel experience in 2024, reflecting a growing desire for unique and tailor-made itineraries. However, 67% of small to medium-sized travel agencies struggle with operational inefficiencies due to the manual handling of these itineraries, often resulting in errors and reduced client satisfaction (Skift Research, 2023).

TravelMate faced the difficulty of tracking and managing client needs alongside their increasing workload. The Global Business Travel Association (2023) reported that 75% of travel agencies have seen a 50% increase in client expectations for personalised service, significantly increasing the workload on travel agents. This manual process often led to delays and inconsistencies in service delivery.

The TravelMate Itinerary Builder addresses these issues by providing a streamlined, automated solution that simplifies the process of creating and managing travel itineraries. Automation in travel management, as identified by McKinsey & Company (2024), can reduce operational workload by up to 30%, allowing travel agencies to focus more on enhancing client experiences.

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}USER STORIES}}$

##### ${\textsf{\color{pink}Account Creation and Management}}$

A frequent traveler who likes to keep their plans organised wants to create an account so they can securely store and access their travel itineraries across different devices. Initially, the focus was on simply creating an account, but the revised version emphasizes the need for secure access to itineraries on multiple devices.

**"I am a user without an account and I would like to make one"**

**"I am a user with an existing account and I would like to login"**

##### ${\textsf{\color{pink}Itinerary Creation}}$

A busy professional with limited time for travel planning wants to quickly create a new itinerary by entering key destinations and dates, allowing them to efficiently organize their trip without missing important details. Initially, the idea was centered around simple itinerary creation, but the revision now emphasizes efficiency and the importance of capturing key travel details without hassle.

**"I am a user and I would like to name my itineraries so I can tell them apart"**

**"I am a user and I would like to select destinations from a list of countries"**

**"I am a user and I would like to see details of the destinations before I select one"**

**"I am a user and I would like to add/remove destinations or activities from my itinerary"**

##### ${\textsf{\color{pink}Itinerary Editing}}$

A spontaneous traveler who often changes plans wants to easily edit their existing itinerary to update their travel plans on the go as new opportunities arise. Initially, the story was about basic editing, but the revision now focuses on the need for flexibility and the ability to adapt plans as new opportunities emerge.

**"I am a user and I would like to edit my saved itineraries"**

##### ${\textsf{\color{pink}Data Security}}$

A privacy-conscious traveler wants their personal information and itineraries to be securely stored and encrypted so they can trust the app with sensitive travel details and feel safe using it. Initially, the focus was on basic security, but the refined story now highlights the importance of encryption and trust, particularly for users concerned about privacy.

**"I am a user and I would like my personal information safe and secure"**

**"I am a user and I do not want other people able to login to my account"**

**"I am a user and I do not want other people to create an account with my email"**

##### ${\textsf{\color{pink}User Interface and Experience }}$

A user who values simplicity and aesthetics wants the app to have a clean and intuitive user interface so they can navigate it easily and enjoy using it to plan their trips. Initially, the focus was on functionality, but the revision now emphasizes the aesthetic and user-friendly aspects of the interface, aligning with the personaâ€™s values.

**"I am a user and I want to see examples of the places I can travel to"**

**"I am a user and I would like to view my saved itineraries"**

**"I am a user and I would like to see my trip visually on a map"**

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}PROJECT MANAGEMENT}}$

## ${\textsf{\color{lightblue}Project Management Process Overview}}$

### ${\textsf{\color{pink}Methodology: Agile (Scrum)}}$
Our team is using the Agile (Scrum) methodology to manage the TravelMate Itinerary Builder project. This approach allows us to be flexible and adaptive to changes while ensuring that we deliver value incrementally throughout the project lifecycle (Atlassian, 2024). Key aspects of our project management process include:

1. **Sprint Planning:**
   - At the beginning of each sprint, we hold a planning session where we review the project backlog and prioritise tasks for the upcoming sprint.
   - Tasks are assigned to team members based on their strengths and expertise, ensuring that each person is working on tasks that align with their skill set.

2. **Daily Standups:**
   - We conduct daily standup meetings where each team member provides updates on what they have accomplished, what they plan to work on, and any blockers they are facing.
   - This helps us stay aligned as a team and address any issues promptly.

3. **Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives:**
   - At the end of each sprint, we hold a review session to demonstrate the completed work and gather feedback.
   - We also conduct a retrospective to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how we can enhance our processes in future sprints.

4. **Task Assignments:**
   - Tasks are assigned to team members based on their strengths and expertise. For example:
     - **Mina** is focusing on backend development and project documentation.
     - **James** and **William** are responsible for frontend development and user interface design. They will be working on testing and quality assurance also.
   - This approach ensures that each team member is contributing in areas where they are most effective.

### ${\textsf{\color{pink}Project Initialization}}$

As part of our project management process, we have documented the initial setup and planning stages. Below are screenshots that capture the key moments during the project initialization phase.
