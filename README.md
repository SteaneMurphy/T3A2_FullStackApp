## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}PROJECT DESCRIPTION}}$

### ${\textsf{\color{lightblue}PURPOSE}}$

TravelMate Itinerary Builder is designed to assist TravelMate, a boutique travel agency, in overcoming challenges related to efficiently managing personalised travel itineraries for their clients. According to a study by American Express Travel (2024), 85% of travellers plan to book a personalised travel experience in 2024, reflecting a growing desire for unique and tailor-made itineraries. However, 67% of small to medium-sized travel agencies struggle with operational inefficiencies due to the manual handling of these itineraries, often resulting in errors and reduced client satisfaction (Skift Research, 2023).

TravelMate faced the difficulty of tracking and managing client needs alongside their increasing workload. The Global Business Travel Association (2023) reported that 75% of travel agencies have seen a 50% increase in client expectations for personalised service, significantly increasing the workload on travel agents. This manual process often led to delays and inconsistencies in service delivery.

The TravelMate Itinerary Builder addresses these issues by providing a streamlined, automated solution that simplifies the process of creating and managing travel itineraries. Automation in travel management, as identified by McKinsey & Company (2024), can reduce operational workload by up to 30%, allowing travel agencies to focus more on enhancing client experiences.

## ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}PROJECT MANAGEMENT}}$

## ${\textsf{\color{lightblue}Project Management Process Overview}}$

### ${\textsf{\color{pink}Methodology: Agile (Scrum)}}$

Our team is using the Agile (Scrum) methodology to manage the TravelMate Itinerary Builder project. This approach allows us to be flexible and adaptive to changes while ensuring that we deliver value incrementally throughout the project lifecycle (Atlassian, 2024). Key aspects of our project management process include:

1. **Sprint Planning:**
   - At the beginning of each sprint, we hold a planning session where we review the project backlog and prioritise tasks for the upcoming sprint.
   - Tasks are assigned to team members based on their strengths and expertise, ensuring that each person is working on tasks that align with their skill set.

2. **Daily Standups:**
   - We conduct daily standup meetings where each team member provides updates on what they have accomplished, what they plan to work on, and any blockers they are facing.
   - This helps us stay aligned as a team and address any issues promptly.

3. **Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives:**
   - At the end of each sprint, we hold a review session to demonstrate the completed work and gather feedback.
   - We also conduct a retrospective to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how we can enhance our processes in future sprints.

4. **Task Assignments:**
   - Tasks are assigned to team members based on their strengths and expertise. For example:
     - **Mina** is focusing on backend development and project documentation.
     - **James** and **William** are responsible for frontend development and user interface design. They will be working on testing and quality assurance also.
   - This approach ensures that each team member is contributing in areas where they are most effective.

# INSTALLATION

This project has a combined frontend and backend. Once the repository has been cloned into a new directory, installation steps must be undertaken in two different sub-directories.

Install NVM package manager if you do not already have it installed:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.4/install.sh | bash
```

Please ensure you have installed Node.js in your environment:

```bash
nvm install node
```

## FRONTEND

Navigate to:

```bash
cd src/client/travelApp
```

Once in the main directory for the Vite/React application, dependencies must be installed using:

```bash
npm install
```

Inside this sub-directory is a '.env.development.sample' file and a '.env.production.sample' file. To run a local version of this application, make a copy of the '.env.development.sample' file and name it '.env.development'. In this file is a string called VITE_API_URL. Set this string to the local URL: 'http://localhost:4000' as this is the port that express will use.

## BACKEND

Navigate to:

```bash
cd src/server
```

Once in the main directory for the Express.js application, dependencies must be installed using:

```bash
npm install
```

Inside this sub-directory is a '.env.sample' file. Please make a new file named '.env' and copy the contents of '.env.sample' to the new '.env' file. This file will have two variables "DB_URI" and "JWT_SECRET" that need to be manually set. As this is a public repo, the strings for these two variables have been provided to you (lecturer) in the assessment notes.

## RUNNING THE APPLICATION

Both the local express server and the local react server need to run simultaneously. To run the server, first navigate to the correct directory:

```bash
cd src/server
```

Then initialise the seed file:

```bash
node seed.js
```

Then run the server:

```bash
node index.js
```

Whilst the server is running, navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd src/client/travelApp
```

And run the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
